# odin_recipes
Html recipes website for the odin project course
Skills involved are working with Git repositories, Git staging and commits, Git pushes of commit messages.
Other skills involved are using bash commands to navigate terminal directories as well as moving/copying and writing/reading files with cat and echo commands.  and using terminal to do all Git functions ie; add, commit, push, clone etc.
This file was populated with echo commands and >> 'filename' entirely, as well as being created via an initial echo # odin_recipes command, though I could have used touch to create the blank file, ? is if i could have written with touch in the initial creation as well?
Html skills are mainly based on creating a basic framework including doctype, lang. head consisting of meta, title. body consisting of strong(bold), em(italics), h1-h6(headings), p(paragraphs), ul, ol, ls(lists). a, href, img src and alt (link types).  and perhaps some others I'm missing currently.  Will try to update with more information or follow up upon project completion.
